# A Morphometric Characterization of Early Chick Embryo Elongation
This R project contains the data collected from an experimental study to characterize the ckick elongation in early stages. The dataset as well as R notebook is available here.

These data were provided by Prof. Raquel P. Andrade (rgandrade@ualg.pt), and Ana Cristina Maia-Fernandes (ac.maia.fernandes@gmail.com), from Universidade do Algarve, Faro, Portugal.

## Dependencies
R packages required to run the project:
- dplyr, tidyverse, and magrittr - needed to manipulate data;
- ggplot2, ggthemes, GGally, viridis, and ggridges - needed to visualize data;
- FactoMineR and factoextra - needed to perform the PCA analysis and visualization.
